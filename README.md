                             NAUTRAL HEALINGS SKINCARE
                             
    Natural healings skincare is a startup company. Andra is the companys founder and is the creator of all of the 
    products listed. Their mission statement is to deliver natural, homemade and handmade products. Andra has noticed 
    that her sales are not increasing, therefore she isnt making a large enough turnover for reproduction. Natural 
    Healings Skincare has a pressence on social media but there is no official website for potential customers to 
    browse on. Andra feels that this is portraying a lack of professionalism and also advertisement. 
    
    
    
    STRATEGY PLAN:
    The focus audience we want to attract is business to consumer and to portray the products in a way that best
    represents the company. Customers will find that the webpage is simple and easy to navigate 
    around. They can browse through the small range of products simply and easily. Andra wants a very simple and 
    clean presentation to correspond with the simplicity of her products. The value of creating the page is to increase sales and to develop an business image
    that is not soley related to generic social media sites. This page will be her online business card of sorts and will be proof for her customers of the businesses abilities.
    
    
    SCOPE PLAN:
    Features that we want included are:
    Content regarding prices and product information. 
    Login :Displayed in nav bar at top of page
    create an account.:displayed in nav bar at top of page;
    
    BRANDING:
    Products and purchases will be the second half of the page, we want the page split into three sections. First, from the top is the navbar, then logo and finally the products. 
    Advertising the Skincare product is most important to our branding as they are the foundation of business and the focal point. 
    
    
    STRUCTURE PLANE:
    The structure of the products will be simply displayed and give quick answers. The page will be intuitive and easily learned.
    The customer will be presented with images of the products in the form of product cards. 
    Within the cards the name of the product will appear along with the price. There will be a more details dropdown option which will inform the consumer on what
    exactly the product does and an ingredients list. All this information is accessed on one page. It is important that the consumer does not need to continuously be
    redirected to a new page per product. Therefore they can easily and quickly browse through each product without having to make use of the back button. 
    
    
    SKELETON PLAN:
    how will user navigate, what relationship will content have, what has priority , and lower priority
    
    Our navigation bar will be place at the top of the page as it is conventual and common. Within the navigation bar will be our jewelery , skin and home anchors. 
    We will have a login/signup section in our navbar, also following conventual layouts. 
    The page will be split into four parts, our nav, logo image, products and finally our footer. This is so that when consumers arrive on the page the first imagery
    that they are introduced to is the products logo. This page layout will remain the same throughtout the entire site as we want to keep continuity and to keep our
    consumers comfortable. 
    
    
    
    
    
    SURFACE PLAN:
    The page will have a very soft and simply look. We dont want vibrant colors as we feel that it doesnt correspond with the notion of natural ingredients.
    The products packaging is black with colorful highlights, therefore the page has to appear as neutural as possible. The products logo will be the focal point of the page.
