                             NAUTRAL HEALINGS SKINCARE
                             
    Natural healings skincare is a startup company. Andra is the companys founder and is the creator of all of the 
    products listed. Their mission statement is to deliver natural, homemade and handmade products. Andra has noticed 
    that her sales are not increasing, therefore she isnt making a large enough turnover for reproduction. Natural 
    Healings Skincare has a pressence on social media but there is no official website for potential customers to 
    browse on. Andra feels that this is portraying a lack of professionalism and also advertisement. 
    
STRATEGY PLAN:
    The focus audience we want to attract is business to consumer and to portray the products in a way that best
    represents the company. Customers will find that the webpage is simple and easy to navigate. They can browse through the small range of products fast and intuitively. Andra wants a very simple and 
    clean presentation to correspond with the simplicity of her products. The value of creating the page is to increase sales and to develop a business image
    that is not soley related to generic social media sites. This page will act as her online business card of sorts and will be proof for her customers of 
    the businesses abilities. 
    
SCOPE PLAN:
    We want the page to have a small amount of features. We want the purchasing process to be as smooth as possible with no room for confusion. 
    Features that we want included are:
    1.Navigation bar
    2.Content regarding prices and product information. 
    3.Images of products
    4.Login page/create an account page. 
    5.Details tags on products to give quick access to information without having to leave the page. Thus no need for the back button . 
    6.Social media icons with anchors to social media sites.Which is giving cutsomers a more casual look into the business and also increasing advertising. 
    7. Purchase review/payment login/signup page all created with the use of forms
    8.Footer containing social media links and contact details. 
    9. Thank you page with return button.
    
    
STRUCTURE PLANE:
    The structure of the page is very basic and easily interpreted. 
    The customer will be presented with a navbar,images of the products in the form of product cards, logo and footer. 
    Within the cards the name of the product will appear along with the price. There will be a more details dropdown option which will inform the consumer on what
    exactly the product does and an ingredients list. All this information is accessed on one page. It is important that the consumer does not need to continuously be
    redirected to a new page per product. Therefore they can easily and quickly browse through each product without having to make use of the back button. 
    The product cards on  medium or large devices are displayed in thirds and on a small devices as half of the bootstrap grid. This allows all users to travel through a
    structured design with a consistent flow. 
     When the page is resized the nav bar will condense and a toggle button  will appear. I set the logo  image to also resize for smaller devices as it was making the user scroll for too long 
    before reaching the merchandise. The social media icons are set to not appear in the navbar once it is being viewed on a smaller device. I felt it clutterd the page. 
    
    Within the product cards there is a "buy now" button. Once clicked on the customer is redirected to a product review page. here they can specifiy the quantity they want, their shipping
    details and personal details. Following this is a "continue to Payment" page. I wanted to separate these pages as I thought it may not provoke a positive response to have a long page
    requesting information. Once the payment details are entered the customer is sent to the "thank you" page which also contains their reference number. On this "thank you"page 
    is a "return to shopping" button which will allow the consumer to return to browsing. I wanted to create a full circle of events which eventually led back to the homepage. 
    
    The login or sign-up option is available in the nav bar. once clicked on the user is redirected to a page where they can either log in or sign up. If the have an account and successfully login
    they are redirected back to the homepage to begin shopping. If they want to sign up the user will fill out a short form, upon completion the user is redirected to a welcome page, which
    asks them to verify their account via email. 
    
    Finally we have a footer. The footer contains contact details, here the consumer can access The company email address and telephone number. 
    To the right of this is more social media icons which when clicked on will take the user to the relevant pages. 
    
    
SKELETON PLANE:
    Our navigation bar will be placed at the top of the page as it is conventual and commonly used. Within the navigation bar will be our jewellery , skin and login/signup anchors. 
    The page will be split into four parts, our nav, logo image, products and finally our footer. Within the nav bar and footer is social media logos which 
    also acts as a link when clicked on. I wanted the Navigation bar to be as bare as possible so the user didnt waste anytime
    trying to make a descision. When consumers arrive on the page the first imagery that they are introduced to is the products logo. There will be an existing theme throughtout the entire site as we want to keep continuity and to keep our
    consumers comfortable. On the opening page the consumer will be presented with two images, one jewelery and the other skincare. I wanted to separate the products to help give  focus to individual
    products. I included the stretched link tag within the images so that the consumer can click anywhere on the image and then be redirected. 
    Our main content area of each page has the same layout and shape. I did this as to give no surprises to the user. 
    I wanted very little features on the screen as not to overwhelm the user and not to make the experience too complex. 

    
SURFACE PLANE:
    The page has a very soft and simple look. I didnt want any vibrant colors as I feel that it doesnt correspond with the notion of natural ingredients.
    The products packaging is black with colorful highlights, therefore the page has to appear as neutural as possible, I dont want too much visual stimulation.
    A gradient effect is applied to the navigation bar and footer to make a smooth transition between the end of logo and end of products. The color #f8ebe3 is taken from the lightest color within the products logo, which I got from
    using the color picker in the developer tools. The buttons and the social media icons on the page are all black to match with the products. The products packaging is predominantly black but I didnt
    want to use this as the general theme across the page because black is a very visually heavy color. So I opted for little black details around the page. The social media
    icons in the nav bar when hovered turn to purple, which again is a connecting theme between the page and the product. 
    
    For the typography I wanted to use a very crisp and classic looking font. I used the crimmson font from the google font library. I felt it was a close match to the font
    displayed in the logo that was supplied. In the Nav bar I used the "dancing script"  for the company's name from the google fonts lirbrary. In some of Andras products she
    has a cursive style font so I wanted to tie that in with the page.Conforming to conventional structure the companys name when clicked on  also takes the user  back to the homepage.
    When you click on the details options on the products I used the <em> tag in the product description. 
    I felt that added a little bit of font contrast across the page, thus keeping users more interested. 
    
    For large devices I applied an opacity filter  for when the product cards are hovered over. I made use of this feature because on larger devices its a nice indication of where
    you are on the page and its an interactive experience for the user. obviously this feature is disabled in smaller devices because there is no hover action when using a touch device.
    I also added some box shadow to the card to make them appear more seperate from one another and makes the layout look more defined rather than lumped together.
    
    I have created forms for the product review page, payment page, login/signup page. The forms are surrounded by a black rounded border, which I help keeps the page look 
    tidy. The different sections are separated by horizontal lines, again the purpose of this is to keep the page looking tidy and helping the user breakdown the information
    with ease and speed. With that in mind I also used placeholders within each text input. A "required" attribute was applied to the important information needed to process the order
    this means that the user cant mistakenly forget to supply information. A terms and conditions document is also requried to be read. This is highlighted in blue to help differentiate 
    from the surrouding text . Once clicked on it opens up into a new page, therefore keeping the user on our page and preventing any progress being lost. 
    

    
    
    
    Overall I feel the page does what it was intended to. It achieves the objective which was to create a platform representing the company
    in a unqiue and specific way. Also it gives the user exactly what they need and want which is fast access to information to make an informed purchase.  
    It has taken Andras products into a league of their own rather than being advertised on generic social media pages.
    Most importantly it has given consumers the independence to purchase how they please. Through social media pages purchasing is a drawn out process. 
    Where as Here on this page its down to the user and the process is quick , easy and simple. 
    It also allows customers to create accounts and be open to customer loyalty deals etc..thus creating the desire to return. 
    The simplicity of the page allows for the companys growth, alterations and add-ons to be made with ease from this point on.
