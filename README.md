                             NAUTRAL HEALINGS SKINCARE
                             
    Natural healings skincare is a startup company. Andra is the companys founder and is the creator of all of the 
    products listed. Their mission statement is to deliver natural, homemade and handmade products. Andra has noticed 
    that her sales are not increasing, therefore she isnt making a large enough turnover for reproduction. Natural 
    Healings Skincare has a pressence on social media but there is no official website for potential customers to 
    browse on. Andra feels that this is portraying a lack of professionalism and also advertisement. 
    
    The aim in creating this webpage is to attract more customers and to portray her products in a way that best
    represents her companys mission statement. Customers will find that the webpage is simple and easy to navigate 
    around. They can browse through the small range of products simply and easily. Andra wants a very simple and 
    clean presentation to correspond with the simplicity of her products. 
    
    Upon entry to the site users will be met with two options, jewelery or skincare. Once chosen the customer will
    be reidrected to another page where all products will be displayed. When the customer has chosen a product they
    want they can then proceed to the product review page and finally shippment and payment details.
